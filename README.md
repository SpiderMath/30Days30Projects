# 30Days30Projects

Hey there, this is Detective Detective 🕵️ here. Welcome to my repository. 👋  


Here I have (or will have for now) 30 Python projects, which are done per day. The YouTube playlist link will be found here soon. 😉  


The reason I'm doing this challenge is because I want to learn Python 🐍, and to do that, I need to stop procrastinating 😳. So this exercise 💪 will make me work (hopefully 😅)
